Independent and joint associations of key social exposome components with cognitive aging: Triangulating evidence through cross-national data. American Journal of Epidemiology, kwaf189.\n\n\nA central focus of my research is understanding how social determinants, including financial strain, educational attainment, and social connections, shape health and well-being in later life, and how these processes contribute to persistent racial disparities in aging-related outcomes. This work is grounded in foundational social epidemiologic and sociological frameworks, including the weathering hypothesis, cumulative disadvantage theory, and theories of social mobility.\nA core set of questions in my research asks how, when, and through what mechanisms social determinants influence health outcomes. By identifying sensitive periods and cumulative processes through which social conditions become biologically embedded, my work aims to inform the timing and targeting of interventions and social policies that can improve health and reduce inequities in later life.\nMuch of the existing literature examines life-course social determinants in isolation, often focusing on single exposures such as education or income. In contrast, my research argues that social determinants do not operate independently. Rather, they are cumulative, interrelated, and mutually reinforcing, jointly shaping health trajectories over time. In my early work, conducted in collaboration with David R. Williams (Harvard), Laura Kubzansky (Harvard), Adolfo Cuevas (NYU), Jennifer Weuve (BU), and Natalie Slopen (Harvard), I examined how cumulative stress exposures contribute to health outcomes and health inequalities, including obesity and cognitive function. This work highlighted the importance of considering the joint burden of multiple stressors on health inequalities.\nBuilding on this foundation, my more recent research extends these ideas by drawing on methods from environmental epidemiology to study the “social exposome,” or the totality of social exposures across the life course. This approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of social environments and their combined effects on health in older adulthood.\nStudying social determinants of health across the life course raises substantial methodological challenges. These include addressing time-varying confounding and treatment–confounder feedback, leveraging data from different historical periods to construct life-course cohorts, and disentangling social causation from reverse causality, particularly in the context of cognitive aging. Many of these challenges remain unresolved in life-course epidemiology. My research aims to develop and apply advance methodological strategies to address these issues, and I welcome collaborations that advance both substantive and methodological work in this area."

    "text": "Social connections and late-life brain health\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman lives are inherently social. The ways in which people connect to one another influence health behaviors across the life course, access to social and material resources, and ultimately shape vulnerability to disease in later life. The COVID-19 pandemic marked a critical reckoning with the role of social connection in health and it highlights how social isolation and loneliness can exacerbate health risks and widen existing inequalities.\nMy research examines the extent to which social connection, including social network, social isolation, and loneliness, contributes to brain health outcomes in later life. While often treated as a straightforward exposure–outcome relationship, this association is conceptually and methodologically complex. A longstanding issue in the literature is the substantial heterogeneity in how social isolation is operationalized, including differences in domains, thresholds, and time frames. My work leverages computational methods and large-scale data to systematically evaluate how alternative operationalizations of social isolation shape estimated associations with cognitive function.\nAnother major methodological concern in this area is reverse causality. Declining cognitive function may lead to social withdrawal, making it difficult to disentangle whether social isolation is a cause or a consequence of cognitive decline. In collaboration with Scott Zimmerman (Boston University), Jackie Torres (UCSF), Ashwin Kowtal (UCSF), and other colleagues, I have applied Mendelian approaches using data from the UK Biobank to examine the relationships among Alzheimer’s disease genetic risk scores, midlife social connection, and later-life cognitive outcomes. This work aims to strengthen causal inference by addressing bidirectional pathways between social isolation and cognitive function.\nThe relationship between social connection and cognitive aging continues to intrigue me. Patterns of social connection vary by culture, sociodemographic characteristics, historical period, and birth cohort. Understanding how these differences shape lived experiences and their health consequences, and how methodological choices condition what we observe, remains a central focus of my research agenda.\n\n\nSelected grant:\nNIH P01: Improving Causal Inference in Alzheimer’s Disease Prevention Research on Modifiable Risk Factors: The Triangulation of Innovative Methods to End AD (TIME-AD) Project (Co-I)\nAlzheimer’s Association: Social Isolation and Dementia Risk: Cross National and Temporal Comparison\nSelected papers:\n(co-first) Zimmerman, S.C., Chen, R., Thoma, M., Pacca, L., Hebert, J., Riley, A., Kim, M.H., Pederson, A., Yang, Y., Buto, P. and Brenowitz, W.D.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 119(40), e2210941119.\n\n\nMy work identifies who is most affected by disease, where health inequities are concentrated, and where policy attention and resources are most urgently needed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, as part of a multi-institutional team with Yea-Hung Chen (UCSF), Alicia Riley (UC Santa Cruz), Matthew Kiang (Stanford), Andrew Stokes (BU), Maria Glymour (BU), Marie-Laure Charpignon (Kaiser Permanente and UC Berkeley), and others, we analyzed death certificate data to examine how excess mortality disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minoritized populations.\nBeyond documenting disparities, my research examines how existing social policies, such as pension systems, shape population health. Social policies shape access to resources, structure exposure to risks, and provide forms of protection across the life course. They play a fundamental role in producing and sustaining health inequalities.\nWhile rigorous evidence is necessary, it is not sufficient. The broader aim of my work is to contribute policy-relevant knowledge that can inform interventions and social policies that meaningfully improve population health and reduce inequalities. Supported by a K99/R00 grant, my current research bridges social epidemiology and policy by examining how social policies in the United States and across countries shape dementia-related outcomes over the life course.\nThe social epidemiologic research that we are doing is not only to shed light on how social factors influence health, but more importantly to investigate how these findings can be translated into policy and programs. I view “translation” as operating not only at the state and national policy levels, but also at the community level, where policies and programs are implemented and experienced. Partnerships with community organizations offer an important pathway for translating these findings into programs that are responsive to local contexts and lived experience."
